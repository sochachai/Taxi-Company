This project aims to provide analytic solutions for a transportation network company, Ultimate, to the following questions.
1. What are the underlying patterns of the demand with respect to time?
2. Construct an experiment to test whether a reimbursement plan to drivers would generate benefits.
3. Establish predictive models for retention. Discover what factors are the best predictors for retention of users. 
The data sets we have are logins.json(contains simulated timestamps of user logins) and ultimate_data_challenge.json(contains details on users regarding their riding experience).
